	// DataDir is the directory used for local Pebble data and WAL segments.

	// BranchPoint, if set, causes the node to bootstrap from a specific source
	// checkpoint on first boot. Unlike RestorePoint, it does not require S3

	// creates its own checkpoints and compacts away the inherited data.

	// is much lower, but up to SegmentMaxAge of acknowledged writes can be lost
	// if local storage is destroyed before the upload completes. Use this when
	// local storage is already durable (e.g. a PVC).
	//

	// FollowerMaxRetries is the number of consecutive stream failures a follower
	// tolerates before attempting a TakeOver election.

	// before applying a batch to Pebble and acknowledging it to the client.
	// Default: FollowerWaitQuorum.

	// PeerBufferSize is the number of WAL entries the leader buffers for
	// follower catch-up. Default: 10 000.
	PeerBufferSize int

	// WatchSendTimeout is the maximum time the etcd Watch surface waits for
	// a single WatchResponse to enter the per-stream send buffer before the
	// watch is considered slow and canceled. On cancellation the server
	// best-effort sends `Canceled=true, CancelReason="mvcc: watcher is
	// slow"` and releases the per-watch goroutine; other watches on the
	// same stream are unaffected. Default: 30 s.
	WatchSendTimeout time.Duration

	// PeerServerTLS is the transport credentials used by the leader's peer
	// gRPC server. Nil means plaintext (only safe inside a trusted network).

	// Logger, if set, receives all t4 log output.  When nil the global
	// logrus logger is used (logrus.StandardLogger()).
	//
	// In embedded mode, supply your own Logger to control destination, level,
	// and format independently from t4's internals.  This also silences the
	// noisy Pebble storage-engine messages (WAL recovery, compaction) which
	// are downgraded to DEBUG by the built-in Pebble adapter – so setting
	// your logger's level to INFO or above is enough to hide them.
	//
	// *logrus.Logger already implements Logger.  For other libraries:
	//
	//	// Silence all t4 output:
	//	cfg.Logger = t4.NoopLogger

	// Pass a *prometheus.Registry to isolate t4 metrics from the global
	// registry (useful when embedding t4 in applications that manage their
	// own Prometheus registries). The first registration also sets the gatherer
	// served by Node.ServeMetrics when the registerer implements
