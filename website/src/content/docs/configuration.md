| `RestorePoint`        | `*RestorePoint`                    | `nil`            | Bootstrap from a specific S3 version (requires S3 versioning). See [Point-in-time restore](api.md#point-in-time-restore-s3-versioning).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `SegmentMaxSize`      | `int64`                            | 50 MB            | WAL segment rotation threshold in bytes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| `SegmentMaxAge`       | `time.Duration`                    | 10 s             | WAL segment rotation age threshold. When `WALSyncUpload` is `false` this also controls how often async uploads run.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `WALSyncUpload`       | `*bool`                            | `true`           | Controls WAL segment upload behaviour. `true` (default): each sealed segment is uploaded to S3 synchronously before the write returns — safe when local storage is ephemeral. `false`: uploads happen asynchronously every `SegmentMaxAge`; write latency is lower but up to `SegmentMaxAge` of acknowledged writes can be lost on simultaneous node + S3 failure. Set to `false` when local storage is durable (e.g. a PVC) and low latency matters. **Note: in cluster mode this flag only affects the initial follower WAL. The leader always opens its WAL with async uploads (`becomeLeader` hardcodes this), since quorum commit already provides write durability.** |
| `CheckpointInterval`  | `time.Duration`                    | 15 min           | How often the leader writes a checkpoint to S3. Set to 0 to disable.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| `CheckpointEntries`   | `int64`                            | 0                | Also trigger a checkpoint after this many WAL entries (0 = disabled).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

### Using a custom S3-compatible store

`object.Store` is a five-method interface (`Put`, `Get`, `Delete`, `DeleteMany`, `List`). Implement it to use any storage backend.

```go
type Store interface {
    Put(ctx context.Context, key string, r io.Reader) error
    Get(ctx context.Context, key string) (io.ReadCloser, error)
    Delete(ctx context.Context, key string) error
    DeleteMany(ctx context.Context, keys []string) error
    List(ctx context.Context, prefix string) ([]string, error)
}
```

`List` must return keys in lexicographic order. `Delete` and `DeleteMany` must not fail when keys are already absent.

Advanced embedders can also replace the WAL by implementing `WALWriter`:

```go
type WALWriter interface {
    Open(dir string, term uint64, startRev int64) error
    ReplayLocal(db wal.RecoveryStore, afterRev int64) error
    Append(e *wal.Entry) error
    AppendBatch(ctx context.Context, entries []*wal.Entry) error
    SealAndFlush(nextRev int64) error
    Close() error
}
```

Custom WAL implementations must preserve the same durability ordering as the default filesystem WAL.

`pkg/object` provides `NewS3Store` (AWS SDK v2) and `NewMem` (in-memory, for tests).

Optionally implement `ConditionalStore` for atomic election writes:

```go
type ConditionalStore interface {
    Store
    GetETag(ctx context.Context, key string) (*GetWithETag, error)
    PutIfAbsent(ctx context.Context, key string, r io.Reader) error // If-None-Match: *
    PutIfMatch(ctx context.Context, key string, r io.Reader, etag string) error // If-Match: <etag>
}
```

Both `S3Store` and `Mem` implement `ConditionalStore`. If your custom store does not, election falls back to an
unconditional write + read-back (slightly less race-safe under concurrent startup), and liveness touches fall back to
unconditional PUT (the Read→Touch split-brain protection is not available).

## CLI: `t4 run`

Start a node. All flags below are sub-flags of the `run` subcommand.

```bash
t4 run [flags]
```

### Environment variables

Most `t4` CLI flags can also be set via `T4_*` environment variables. Command-line flags take precedence over
environment variables. Environment variables are only applied when the corresponding flag was not set explicitly, and
empty environment variable values are ignored.

Required flags such as `--s3-bucket`, `--branch-id`, and `--data-dir` can be satisfied by their documented environment
variables.

For S3 credentials, `t4` fails closed unless you configure credentials explicitly. Use
`T4_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID` + `T4_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` for static credentials, or set `--s3-profile` / `T4_S3_PROFILE`
to opt into the AWS shared config chain. If you want the shared `default` profile, set `T4_S3_PROFILE=default`
explicitly.

Example:

```bash
export T4_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/t4
export T4_S3_BUCKET=my-bucket
export T4_S3_PREFIX=prod/cluster-a
export T4_NODE_ID=node-a

t4 run --listen 0.0.0.0:3379
```

## CLI: `t4 branch`

Manage database branches.

### `t4 branch fork`

```bash
t4 branch fork \
  --s3-bucket <bucket> --s3-prefix <source-prefix> \
  --branch-id <id> \
  [--checkpoint <checkpoint-key>]
```

Registers a new branch against the source store. Prints the checkpoint key to stdout. Pass that key as
`--branch-checkpoint` when starting the branch node.

| Flag                     | Description                                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `--s3-bucket`            | S3 bucket of the source database                          |
| `--s3-prefix`            | S3 prefix of the source database                          |
| `--s3-endpoint`          | Custom S3 endpoint (optional)                             |
| `--s3-region`            | S3 region (optional)                                      |

| `--s3-secret-access-key` | S3 secret access key (optional)                           |
| `--branch-id`            | Unique identifier for the branch                          |
| `--checkpoint`           | Fork from a specific checkpoint key instead of the latest |

### `t4 branch unfork`

```bash
t4 branch unfork \
  --s3-bucket <bucket> --s3-prefix <source-prefix> \
  --branch-id <id>
```

Removes the branch registry entry from the source store. The next GC run on the source may reclaim SSTs that are no
longer needed.
