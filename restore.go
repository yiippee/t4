// RestorePoint describes a precise point in time from which a node should
// bootstrap. When set in Config, the node restores the checkpoint and replays
// the listed WAL segments using their pinned S3 version IDs, rather than
// reading the latest objects from its own prefix.
//
// This enables point-in-time restore, blue/green deployments, and copy-free
// forking: the source data is read directly from S3 by version ID — no objects
// are copied to the new prefix.
//
// The node's own ObjectStore prefix is used for all subsequent writes after
// startup. RestorePoint is only applied on first boot (when the local data
// directory does not yet exist); it is ignored on subsequent restarts.
//
// S3 versioning must be enabled on the source bucket.
type RestorePoint struct {
	// Store is the versioned object store to read pinned objects from.
	// It may use a different prefix than Config.ObjectStore (e.g. to read
	// from the source branch while writing to a new branch prefix).
	Store object.VersionedStore

	// CheckpointArchive is the pinned checkpoint archive object.
	CheckpointArchive PinnedObject

	// CheckpointFiles are the pinned SST and Pebble metadata objects referenced
	// by CheckpointArchive. Supplying them makes restore independent of source
	// checkpoint GC. If omitted, T4 falls back to reading those objects from
	// the live store for compatibility with older callers.

// BranchPoint describes a source checkpoint from which a new branch node
// should bootstrap. Unlike RestorePoint, it does not require S3 versioning —
// SST files are protected by registering the branch in the source store via
// checkpoint.RegisterBranch before starting the node.
//
// On first boot (local data directory does not exist), the node downloads the
// source checkpoint's SST files and Pebble metadata, then writes its own
// checkpoint to Config.ObjectStore. Subsequent restarts use local disk only.
type BranchPoint struct {
	// SourceStore is the object store of the source node.
